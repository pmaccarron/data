# data

Some social network datasets from  epic narratives.

Data is in a tab separated file with the following headers: <br />
Character \t Friendly edges \t Hostile edges

Some datasets are broken into chapters, look for lines beginning with one of:<br />
%Scene or %Chapter or %Book<br />
Some lines will also begin with a % so ignore those lines!

Can have multiple edges based on appearances in different scenes/chapters.


Note, the three datasets "Tain.tsv", "Beowulf.tsv" and "Iliad.tsv" contain the social network data for the three epics used in Mac Carron & Kenna (2012) EPL (Europhysics Letters) 99.2: 28002.<br />
However, since then some of the datasets were updated (and I don't seem to have the earlier versions :/ ). 
Any value reported in my PhD thesis will be the value used from the final (and most correct) dataset. The thesis can be accessed here:<br />
