# data

Some network datasets.

Data is in a tab separated file with the following headers:
Character \t Gender \t Friendly edges \t Hostile edges

Some datasets are broken into chapters, look for lines beginning with one of:
#Scene or #Chapter or #Book

Can have multiple edges based on appearances in different scenes/chapters.
