# data

Some network datasets.

Data is in a tab separated file with the following headers: 
Character \t Gender \t Friendly edges \t Hostile edges

Some datasets are broken into chapters, look for lines beginning with one of:
%Scene or %Chapter or %Book
Some heading will also begin with a % so ignore those lines

Can have multiple edges based on appearances in different scenes/chapters.
